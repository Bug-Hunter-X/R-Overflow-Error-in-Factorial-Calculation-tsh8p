```R
# This code attempts to perform a calculation involving a large number of iterations.
# However, it may lead to unexpected results or errors due to limitations in R's handling of very large numbers or potential memory issues.

# Example: Calculating the factorial of a large number
factorial_large <- function(n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return(1)
  } else {
    return(n * factorial_large(n - 1))
  }
}

result <- factorial_large(1000)
print(result)
